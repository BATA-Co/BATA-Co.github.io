abstract: 'Several authorship analysis tasks require the decomposition of multi-authored text into its authorial components. Authorship identification is an important task within stylometry that can be applied to many cases. For example, determining the author of a ransom note can save someone’s life, discovering whether all the uploaded assignments of a student are classified as their own work can reduce the amount of plagiarism, but it can be also applied in arts to identify an author of an old text. The documents clustering task, by author’s linguistic style, is also of vital importance in forensic applications. In this project, we focus on unsupervised authorship analysis and provide an evaluation framework and a random baseline to compare different approaches. In this work, given a collection of short documents, we approach the author clustering task to determine which documents are written by the same author. The number of clusters is determined through the computation of silhouettes for some approaches. Several approaches are compared but Affinity Propagation clustering method has the best result with 0.51 average B-Cubed F-score without using n-gram features, and it is improved to 0.61 using n-gram features. Several features including Punctuations frequency, small tokens frequency, average tokens length, stop words frequency, Part of speech tags frequency and function words are extracted from data. Text data are gathered from 6 different Persian newspaper authors.'
