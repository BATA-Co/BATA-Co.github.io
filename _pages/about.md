I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science working on Predictive Monitoring and Adaptation of Business Processes in [Business Process Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management) research area. I am passionate about Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

I hold Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology Engineering (2011-2015) and Master of Science in Software Engineering (2015-2018) from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). In my PhD, I have gained more insight on analyzing business processes such as process mining, predictive process monitoring and process adaptation as well as developing my research and presentation skills.

Apart from my studies, I have also worked in companies using different programming languages such as Python and Java as a software engineer. For example, I have worked as an Android Software Developer for about a year and worked in the Internet of Things lab of Computer Engineering and Information Technology faculty of the Amirkabir University of Technology as a Software Engineer.

In my free time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly swimming, football, and gymming), traveling, and going out with friends and family. I have grown up in [Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran) and speak [Farsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language), English, and a bit of Dutch.
